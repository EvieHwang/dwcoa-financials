# Feature Specification: Unit Statement Tracking ("My Account" Section)

**Feature Branch**: `feature/002-unit-statement-tracking`
**Created**: 2026-01-21
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: Requirements document `docs/statement-tracking-requirements.md`

## Overview

Add a "My Account" section to the dashboard that provides homeowners with visibility into their annual dues obligation, payment progress, and recommended monthly payment. This enables homeowners to self-manage their payment schedules without requiring treasurer intervention.

Key insight: Homeowners want to understand their financial obligations at a glance - what they owe, what they've paid, and what they need to pay each month to stay current. The treasurer wants carryover balances to calculate automatically when locking a new year's budget.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Select Unit and View Statement (Priority: P1)

A homeowner visits the dashboard and selects their unit from a dropdown. The page displays their personalized financial statement showing last year's summary, current year's dues, payments made, and remaining balance.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value - homeowners can self-serve their financial status without contacting the treasurer.

**Independent Test**: Select unit 201 from dropdown; see personalized statement with correct ownership percentage (10.4%), calculated dues, and payment history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the dashboard is loaded, **When** user selects unit 201, **Then** the My Account section displays with that unit's financial data
2. **Given** a unit was previously selected, **When** user returns to the dashboard later, **Then** the same unit is pre-selected (persisted in localStorage)
3. **Given** no unit is selected, **When** viewing dashboard, **Then** display prompt "Select your unit to view your statement"
4. **Given** user is admin role, **When** selecting different units, **Then** can view any unit's statement (for support purposes)

### User Story 2 - View Last Year Summary (Priority: P2)

A homeowner sees their prior year's financial summary: what they were budgeted to pay, what they actually paid, and any balance (positive or negative) that carried forward to the current year.

**Why this priority**: Understanding the carryover balance is essential for homeowners to trust their current year's total.

**Independent Test**: For a unit that underpaid by $160 last year, statement shows: Annual dues budgeted $3,960, Total paid $3,800, Balance carried forward $160.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Unit 201 had $3,960 budgeted and paid $3,800 in 2025, **When** viewing 2026 statement, **Then** shows $160 carried forward
2. **Given** Unit 102 overpaid by $150 in 2025, **When** viewing statement, **Then** shows "($150.00) credit" carried forward
3. **Given** no budget existed for prior year, **When** viewing statement, **Then** shows "No data available for [year]"

---

### User Story 3 - View Current Year Summary (Priority: P1)

A homeowner sees their current year's total obligation: carryover balance plus annual dues, minus payments made, equals remaining balance.

**Why this priority**: This answers the fundamental question "How much do I owe?"

**Independent Test**: Unit with $160 carryover + $4,104 annual dues - $700 paid = $3,564 remaining balance displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** carryover of $160 and annual dues of $4,104, **When** viewing current year, **Then** total due shows $4,264
2. **Given** total due of $4,264 and $700 paid YTD, **When** viewing, **Then** remaining balance shows $3,564
3. **Given** budget is not yet locked, **When** viewing statement, **Then** displays notice "Budget for [year] is pending approval. Amounts shown are preliminary."
4. **Given** a credit carryover of -$150, **When** calculating total due, **Then** credit reduces total (e.g., $4,104 - $150 = $3,954 total due)

---

### User Story 4 - View Payment Guidance (Priority: P2)

A homeowner sees the standard monthly payment (annual dues / 12) and a suggested monthly payment (remaining balance / months remaining) to help them budget.

**Why this priority**: Proactive guidance helps homeowners stay current without treasurer reminders.

**Independent Test**: In March with $3,564 remaining and 10 months left, suggested payment shows $356.40/month.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** annual dues of $4,104, **When** viewing guidance, **Then** standard monthly shows $342.00
2. **Given** remaining balance of $3,564 and 10 months remaining, **When** viewing guidance, **Then** suggested monthly shows $356.40
3. **Given** remaining balance is $0 or negative, **When** viewing guidance, **Then** shows "Paid in full" or "Credit balance" instead
4. **Given** it's December with $500 remaining, **When** viewing guidance, **Then** shows "Remaining balance: $500 due by Dec 31"

---

### User Story 5 - View Recent Payments (Priority: P3)

A homeowner sees their recent payments to verify checks have been received and processed correctly.

**Why this priority**: Provides confirmation that payments were recorded, reducing support questions.

**Independent Test**: Unit 201 sees last 5 payments with dates and amounts; can click to see full history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Unit 201 made payments on Jan 5 and Feb 3, **When** viewing recent payments, **Then** both payments display with dates and amounts
2. **Given** no payments recorded for current year, **When** viewing, **Then** shows "No payments recorded for [year]"
3. **Given** user clicks "View full history", **When** clicked, **Then** shows all payments for current and prior year

---

### User Story 6 - Automatic Carryover on Budget Lock (Priority: P2)

When the treasurer locks a new year's budget, the system automatically calculates and stores carryover balances for all units, saving manual calculation work.

**Why this priority**: Reduces treasurer workload and eliminates calculation errors.

**Independent Test**: Lock 2026 budget; all 9 units have carryover_balance auto-populated in unit_past_dues table.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin locks 2026 budget, **When** lock completes, **Then** carryover balances are calculated for all 9 units
2. **Given** Unit 201 had prior year budget $3,960, past_due $0, paid $3,800, **When** carryover calculates, **Then** carryover = $160
3. **Given** a unit already has manually-entered past_due for the year, **When** lock runs, **Then** manual value is NOT overwritten
4. **Given** admin views unit past dues, **When** displayed, **Then** can distinguish auto-calculated vs manually-set values

---

### Edge Cases

- **New unit/owner mid-year**: Past due can be manually set to prorate their obligation; auto-calculation won't overwrite
- **Budget unlocked after carryover calculated**: Carryover values remain (they were based on prior year's locked data)
- **Year boundary in January**: Last year = previous calendar year, This year = current calendar year
- **Exactly on track**: When suggested monthly equals standard monthly, display encouraging message
- **All units paid in full**: Payment guidance section still renders but shows positive status

---

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Homeowner can view their statement within 3 seconds of selecting their unit
- **SC-002**: Carryover calculations match manual verification for all 9 units
- **SC-003**: Selected unit persists across browser sessions via localStorage
- **SC-004**: Payment guidance correctly handles edge cases (paid in full, December, credits)
- **SC-005**: Auto-carryover on budget lock completes for all units without errors
- **SC-006**: Admin can distinguish auto-calculated vs manually-set past dues

---

## Assumptions

- Dues payments are identified by the existing "Dues" category (generic) mapped to specific units
- Unit ownership percentages are already stored in the units table
- The budget lock mechanism already exists and functions correctly
- Prior year budget data is available for carryover calculation
- Browser localStorage is available and not blocked

---

## Out of Scope (Future Considerations)

- Email notification when statement is ready (budget locked)
- PDF export of individual unit statement
- Payment reminders / alerts when falling behind
- Individual unit login credentials (currently shared passwords)
- Online payment integration

---

## Dependencies

- Existing budget locking mechanism (already implemented)
- Existing unit_past_dues table (already exists, needs column addition)
- Existing dues calculation logic in /api/dues endpoint
- Dashboard rendering framework (vanilla JS, Chart.js, Tabulator)
